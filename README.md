## Code Samples
Single place for sample projects from my YouTube videos and articles.

### Goals behind the project
1. I want to give you some tips if you are facing implementation problems with specific feature.
2. I want to improve my English skills by writing guides and recording videos.
3. I want to share my observations and knowledge with other people.
4. I want to learn new stuff by doing research.
5. I also treat written guides as my personal (but public) notes.
