## Samples
Single place for sample projects from my YouTube videos and articles.


### Goals behind the project
1. No oversimplified samples
2. I want to give you some inspirations if you facing implementation problems
3. I want to improve my English skills by writing guides and recording videos
4. I want to share my observations and knowledge with other people
5. I want to learn new stuff by doing research
6. I also treat written guides as my personal (but public) notes
