## Code Samples
Single place for sample projects from my articles.

> Any of my guides DOESN'T pretend to show you best practices. I just want to show my way of doing things.

### Goals behind the project
- I want to give you some tips if you are facing implementation problems with specific feature.
- I want to improve my English skills by writing guides.
- I want to share my observations and knowledge with other people.
- I want to learn new stuff by doing research.
- I want to share good resources made by other people (with each guide I also provide useful links).
- I also treat written guides as my personal (but public) notes.

### Audience
I'm targeting more advanced users who mostly understand what they are doing.

### Tech stack
I really want to make each code sample as easy to run as possible, so most samples use:
- SQLite (database in file) to avoid complexity with additional tools/dependencies like Docker.
- npm because I don't want to enforce specific package manager (npm is just installed by default with Node.js, right?).
- Express.js because everyone who uses Node.js knows this framework.

#### + specific for feature libraries. Key factors for library choice:
- library must be popular among the community (example library: PassportJS).
- library cannot be created by me (I don't use guides to promote my own solutions/packages).

#### + I also made some personal choices like:
- TypeScript
- TypeORM
- EJS for HTML templates
- TailwindCSS for styling

### Guides
- [x] [Social login in Node.js](https://github.com/michaldziuba03/code-samples/tree/main/social-login)
- [x] [Reset password in Node.js](https://github.com/michaldziuba03/code-samples/tree/main/reset-password)
- [ ] Link previews in Node.js
