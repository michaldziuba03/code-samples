## Code Samples
Single place for sample projects from my YouTube videos and articles.

### Goals behind the project
1. I want to give you some tips if you are facing implementation problems with specific feature.
2. I want to improve my English skills by writing guides and recording videos.
3. I want to share my observations and knowledge with other people.
4. I want to learn new stuff by doing research.
5. I also treat written guides as my personal (but public) notes.

### Tech stack
I really want to make each code sample as easy to run as possible, so most samples use:
- SQLite (database in file) to avoid complexity with additional tools/dependencies like Docker
- npm because I don't want to enforce specific package manager (npm is just installed by default with Node.js, right?)
- Express.js because everyone who uses Node.js knows this framework

#### + specific for feature libraries. Key factors for library choice:
- library must be popular among the community (example library: PassportJS)
- library cannot be created by me (I don't use guides to promote my own solutions/packages)

I also made some personal choices like:
- TypeScript
- TypeORM
- EJS for HTML templates
- TailwindCSS for styling
